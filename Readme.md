FRCUpload
---------
A tool for uploading FRC robot code to a National Instruments cRIO.

Verify the robot IP address and the WindRiver workspace location before running the script, or it may not work properly.

Tested with C++ code from WindRiver with the 2014 cRIO image, other configurations (such as other languages or images from previous years) may work but should be tested first.
